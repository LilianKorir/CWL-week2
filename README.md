# Let's Groupify!
## Chloe, Lily, Will

Our project provides a method to create random and fair (or close to fair) groupings of people, provided inputs of a list of names and a maximum group size.  

For example, if we pass in the list of our 14 names, and ask for a maximum of 4 people per group, the program will return 2 groups of 4, and 2 groups of 3.

## Instructions for use:
1.  From command line on parent directory, change working directory to "groupify" directory
    - `cd groupify`
2.  Run "groupify.js" in command line, passing "names.txt" as a command line argument
    - `node groupify.js names.txt`




*Note: running this program requires the readline-sync module*
