# Let's Groupify!
## Chloe, Lily, Will

Our project provides a method to create random and fair (or close to fair) groupings of people, provided inputs of a list of names and a maximum group size.

## Instruction for use:
1. From command line on parent directory, change working directory to "groupify" directory
    - `$ cd groupify`
2. Run "groupify.js", passing "names.txt" as a command line argument
    - `$ node groupify.js names.txt`




*Note: running this program requires the readline-sync module*
