# Let's Groupify!
## Chloe, Lily, Will

Our project provides a method to create random and fair (or close to fair) groupings of people, provided inputs of a list of names and a maximum group size.

## Instruction for use:
1. From command line, change working directory to groupify file
    - `$ cd groupify`
2. Run `groupify.js`, passing `names.txt` as a command line argument
    - `$ node groupify.js names.txt`




*Note: running this program requires the readline-sync module*
