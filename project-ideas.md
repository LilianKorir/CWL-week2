# Brainstorming project ideas

## Uses of our topics:
- Command line arguments : take in arguments when running a program through the command line
- Random numbers : 
- Interactive keyboard input : 
- Reading from and writing to files : 

## Project ideas
- Create groups:
    1. Read list of people from a file (could just pass in to command line as list)
    2. Randomize the list of people
    3. Pass max group size in command line
    4. Use a function like "chunk" to split into groups of max group size or less.
